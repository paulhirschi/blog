### Who
I'm Paul Hirschi. I work in applied maths and statistics, currently as Head Data Scientist & AI Engineer at [OptConnect](https://optconnect.com).

### What
This space is primarily a place for me to learn topics important to myself using the Feynman technique; that is, actively teach the topic to identify gaps in my own explanations, seek deeper understanding, organize and simplify, and teach again.

I imagine my most visited topics will relate to the application of maths and statistics. Others may creep in.
